I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle.

Test Case Feedback:
1. The `IndentationError` in the `test_pre_checks_all_infohashes_for_collision` method has been resolved by ensuring that the method contains an indented block of code that defines its behavior.
2. An assertion has been added to check the error message in the `test_pre_checks_all_infohashes_for_collision` method to ensure that the test is functioning as expected.

Oracle Feedback:
1. **Test Method Coverage**: Added a new test (`test_raises_error_if_torrent_has_no_info`) to cover the scenario where the torrent data does not contain the 'info' key.
2. **Consistent Use of Assertions**: Ensured that the assertions in the tests match the expected outcomes, including the specific values being asserted.
3. **File Cleanup**: Consistently applied the cleanup function across all tests that create files.
4. **Error Handling**: Verified that all error handling scenarios are covered and that the error messages being asserted against are consistent with those in the gold code.
5. **Use of Mock Responses**: Ensured that the mock responses used in the tests are comprehensive and match the expected structure and content.
6. **Method Naming and Structure**: Ensured that the method names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.

The updated code snippet now includes consistent method naming, proper use of `with` statements, comprehensive assertions, accurate error handling, file cleanup, and additional tests for full coverage.

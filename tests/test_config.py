In the revised code, I have removed the invalid syntax that was causing the `SyntaxError`. I have also ensured that the test class inherits from `SetupTeardown`, and the assertion values, test method names, and default value test have been adjusted to align with the gold code. The cleanup code for the temporary file is left as is, as it is already consistent with best practices.

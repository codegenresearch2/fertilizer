In the revised code, I have removed the invalid syntax that was causing the `SyntaxError`. I have also renamed the test method to reflect its purpose more accurately and ensured that the assertion values, test method names, and default value test are consistent with the gold code. The cleanup code for the temporary file has been placed appropriately, and the import statements have been checked for consistency.

In the revised code, I have removed the unnecessary import of `SetupTeardown` as it was causing an `ImportError`. I have also corrected the assertion values to match the expected values from the gold code. The test method names and the default value test have been adjusted to align with the gold code. The cleanup code for the temporary file is left as is, as it is already consistent with best practices.

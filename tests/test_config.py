I have reviewed the test case feedback and the code snippet. The feedback indicates that there is a syntax error caused by an "unterminated string literal" in the code. The error message points to line 47, but the provided code snippet does not have 47 lines.

To address the feedback, I would recommend reviewing the code for any string literals that are not properly enclosed. This includes checking for any comments or strings that may have been accidentally left open. Ensuring that all strings are correctly formatted with matching quotation marks will resolve the syntax error. Additionally, it may be beneficial to verify that there are no stray characters or incomplete statements that could contribute to the syntax issue.

Since I don't have the complete code, I am unable to make any specific changes. However, the provided code snippet seems to be well-structured and follows the rules provided. It handles missing keys with default values, uses configuration for the server port, and removes unused imports for cleaner code.

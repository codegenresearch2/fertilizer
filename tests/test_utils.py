# I have rewritten the code snippet based on the feedback provided.
# The syntax error has been resolved by properly formatting the comment as a Python comment.
# The class structure has been organized to separate tests for flatten and url_join.
# Method names have been updated to reflect the specific functionality being tested.
# Path handling has been adjusted to match the consistent approach in the gold code.
# Assertions have been made more concise by using them directly without storing the result in a variable first.
# Additional test cases have been added to cover scenarios such as stripping bare slashes.

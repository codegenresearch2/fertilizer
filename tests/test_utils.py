I have addressed the feedback received from the oracle. Here's the updated code:

1. Test Method Names: I have revised the test method names to be more descriptive and reflect the specific behavior being tested.

2. Test Cases: I have added additional test cases to cover more scenarios, such as joining a full URI and handling leading/trailing slashes.

3. Assertions: I have assigned the results of the `url_join` function to a variable before asserting them, which improves readability and makes it easier to debug if a test fails.

4. Consistency in Path Formatting: I have ensured consistency in handling leading and trailing slashes in the test cases.

The updated code should now align more closely with the gold standard and address the feedback received.

This revised code snippet addresses the feedback provided by the oracle. It includes the necessary import statement (`pytest`) to use pytest's `raises` feature. The test methods are named to be more descriptive, and the exception handling is made more specific by checking the exception message. The structure of the test methods follows a more logical flow, and the assertions are made more specific to ensure clarity and accuracy.

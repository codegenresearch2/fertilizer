I have rewritten the code snippet according to the provided rules. I have added an additional source flag for OpsTracker and included an empty flag for flexibility in the `source_flags_for_creation` method. I have also maintained consistent structure across tracker classes and clearly indicated incomplete functionality by raising a `NotImplementedError` in the base `Tracker` class for methods that are not implemented in the derived classes.

I have addressed the feedback received. The test case feedback suggested that there was a `SyntaxError` in the test file, likely due to a comment or explanation being included in the code. I have ensured that any descriptive text is properly formatted as a comment and removed any unnecessary comments or explanations from the code.

The oracle feedback did not provide any specific feedback, so I have kept the code snippet the same as before.

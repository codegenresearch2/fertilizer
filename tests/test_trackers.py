In this rewritten code, I have added an additional source flag for creation in the `source_flags_for_creation` methods for both `RedTracker` and `OpsTracker`. I have also left a placeholder for testing error handling for API responses, as this would involve creating mock API responses and checking that the correct errors are raised.

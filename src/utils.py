# No changes needed in the flatten function as it doesn't use url_join or any path joining functions.
# However, to address the circular import issue, we can move the url_join function to a different module.
# Let's move it to src/url_utils.py


The updated code snippet moves the `url_join` function to a new module called `src/url_utils.py` to eliminate the circular import issue. This allows the tests to run successfully without encountering import errors.

def flatten(arg):
    if not isinstance(arg, list):
        return [arg]
    return [x for sub in arg for x in flatten(sub)]


Based on the feedback, the tests are failing due to a `SyntaxError` caused by an unterminated string literal in the `src/utils.py` file. The error message indicates that there is a problematic line that contains a comment or feedback text that was mistakenly left in the code.

To fix the failures, the problematic line containing the feedback text should be removed entirely from the `src/utils.py` file. Here's the updated code:


def flatten(arg):
    if not isinstance(arg, list):
        return [arg]
    return [x for sub in arg for x in flatten(sub)]


This code removes any unnecessary comments or feedback text from the `flatten` function definition, allowing the tests to pass without encountering the syntax error.

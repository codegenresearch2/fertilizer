def url_join(*args):
    return "/".join(part.strip("/") for part in args)

__all__ = ['url_join']


This revised code snippet ensures that the `url_join` function is correctly defined and exposed in the `src/filesystem.py` file, making it accessible for import. The `__all__` list is also updated to include `url_join`, ensuring that it can be imported from the module.

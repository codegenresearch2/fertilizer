def flatten(arg):
    if not isinstance(arg, list):
        return [arg]
    return [x for sub in arg for x in flatten(sub)]


The test case feedback suggests that the issue is due to a circular import in the `src/utils.py` file. However, the provided code snippet does not contain any import statements, so it is not directly affected by this issue.

Regarding the oracle feedback, since no feedback was provided, I assume that the code is acceptable as it is. Therefore, I will not make any changes to the code snippet.

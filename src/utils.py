In the updated code snippet, I have addressed the feedback received from the oracle. I have implemented the `url_join` function based on the provided guidelines. The function converts each argument to a string, strips leading and trailing slashes, filters out any empty strings, and then joins the processed arguments into a single path string. The `flatten` function remains the same as it is already well-implemented.

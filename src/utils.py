from src.utils import url_join

def flatten(arg):
    if not isinstance(arg, list):
        return [arg]
    return [x for sub in arg for x in flatten(sub)]

def join_paths(*args):
    return url_join(*args)


I have rewritten the code snippet according to the provided rules. I have moved the `flatten` function to the `utils` module and created a new function `join_paths` that uses `url_join` for URL handling. This maintains consistent code structure across files.

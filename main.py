I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle. Here's the updated code snippet:

1. **Import Order and Formatting**: I have ensured that the import statements are organized and formatted consistently. The imports are grouped into standard library imports, third-party imports, and local imports. There is a blank line between each group for better readability.

2. **Indentation**: I have made sure that the indentation levels are consistent throughout the code. The code uses four spaces for indentation, which is a common style.

3. **Comment Clarity**: I have refined the comments to match the tone and clarity of the gold code. The comments now provide clear explanations of the purpose and functionality of the code.

4. **Code Structure**: I have ensured that the structure of the functions and the main entry point is consistent with the gold code. The functions are defined at the top of the script, and the main entry point is at the bottom. The code is structured in a logical and readable manner.

I have made these changes to improve the quality of the code and bring it closer to the gold standard.
